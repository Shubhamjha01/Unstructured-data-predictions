### Suppose you are going for a walk and you see a really cute dog, you might not be sure of it's breed (unless you are an expert!)
### This model does just what you watn, just click a picture of the dog whose breed you want to identify and feed the function at the bottom of the code!!
### The model will use its wit and let you know the breed. (it has been trained over 10000 dog images of 120 unique breeds!
#### Created with effort and patience using Tensorflow
